      Hey there, I'm Ashanvi and I'm a college student with experience in several different areas.
      I'm great at UI/UX design, which is all about making websites and apps look good and work well.
      I am also learning to work with cloud which means I can design and build secure and scalable solutions using cloud infrastructure. 
      and As a DevOps professional, I'm really good at streamlining the software development process. 
      That means I make sure everything runs smoothly and deployment is easy. And as a web developer, I can use different programming languages such as Javascript, Java and frameworks like React and Three.js to build amazing web applications that meet business needs.

        ))}

    </>
